# SPA React Test

## Environment

This test is consisted of six tasks split into separate folders. Each folder contains a basic React boilerplate to quickly start coding.

### Each task folder contains

- `README.md` file about the target task
- Basic React boilerplate
- Some tasks has a CSS sheet with basic styling
- Tasks titles in `README.md` are hyperlinks. You can use them as a hint about what you might need to slove the corresponding task.

## NOTES

- Focus on functionality, NOT style
- We accept unfinished tasks (Don't delete the code you wrote!)
- Before pushing your code, make sure that you go back to the main directory so that you are actually pushing all of the task folders!
- Submit your code within the given test duration
- Remember that you can push multiple times, even after each separate task!
