### 4. [Move a Box Up](https://malcoded.com/posts/react-component-style/)

Before you start coding make sure to:

- Navigate to the directory `task-04` in your terminal
- Run `npm i` or `npm install`

This challenge requires you to move the position of a provided box upwards whenever the button `Move Up` is clicked.

The tasks in this challenge are:

- Create a state variable to hold the value of the transformation points.
- Handle an event which increments or decrements the transformation points.
- Bind the transformation using inline CSS to the created box.

Hints:
> Use inline style

> `translateY(${transformationPoints}px)`;
